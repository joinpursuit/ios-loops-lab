## Question 1

Write code that prints all the numbers from 1 to 150, **inclusive.**

```swift
for number in 1...150 {
    print(number)
}

```

***
## Question 2

Write code that prints all the numbers from 142 to 159, **exclusive.**

    print(number)
}

```





***
## Question 3

Write code that prints only the even numbers from 15 to 80, **inclusive.**

    if number % 2 == 0 {
    print(number)
}
}

```


***

```swift

for number in 19...51 {
    if number % 2 != 0 {
    print(number)
}
}
```


***
## Question 5

```swift

for number in 1..<100 {
    if number % 10 == 5 {
    print(number)
}
}

```

***
## Question 6

```swift

for number in 1...40 {
    if number % 10 == 7 {
    print(number)
}
}

```

***
## Question 7

Given a range of numbers from 20 to 150 inclusive, print out all the numbers that follows these conditions:

`Numbers that are divisible by 3`

```swift
for number in 20...150 where number % 3 == 0 {
    print(number)
}

```

***
## Question 8

Given a range of numbers from 20 to 150 inclusive, print out all the numbers that follows these conditions:

`Numbers that are divisible by 2 and 3`

```swift

for number in 20...150 where number % 3 == 0 && number % 2 == 0 {
    print(number)
}

```

***
## Question 9

Given a range of numbers from 20 to 150 inclusive, print out all the numbers that follows these conditions:

`Numbers that end with a 4`

```swift

for number in 20...150 where number % 10 == 4 {
    print(number)
}

```


***
## Question 10

Given a range of numbers from 20 to 150, print out all the numbers that follows these conditions:

`Print out numbers: 31, 35, 40 to 60.`

```swift

for number in 20...150 {
if number == 31 || number == 35 || (number > 39 && number <= 60) {
    print(number) }
}

```
***
## Question 11

Without using Xcode, how many times will the loop below run?  Explain why.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

// Answer:

It will keep running infinitely. While adding increments of 1 to a number already more than 3, the while statement will never stop being applicable.
```

***
## Question 12

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing when i reaches 9.

```swift
var i = 5

// Answer:

while (i < 9) {
    i += 1
}
```

***
## Question 13

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i < 1005) {
    i += 1
}
```

***
## Question 14

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times and also make it print out the current value of i **only if i is an even number.**

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

Answer: 

while (i < 1005) {
    i += 1
    if i % 2 == 0 {
    print(i)
    }
}
```

***
## Question 15

What's the difference in syntax between the following two while loops?  Will their outputs be different?  Explain why or why not.

```swift
var i = 1
//loop one
while i <= 10 {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
}

//loop two
var i = 1

repeat {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
} while i <= 10
```
Answer:

Loop One has correct syntax. After setting i to 1, it runs itself at increments of 1 until i becomes 10, printing the value in an interpolated message each time until the loop ends. Loop Two does not run. The increments do not work without first using while and repeat is unneccessary.
# Bonus =)

***
## Question 1

What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?  Give an example that demonstrates their differences.

Break stops the loop from running, continue skips to the next iteration of the loop.
```swift

for num in 1...50{
    if num % 2 == 0 {
        continue
    } else if num == 50 {
        break }
       print(num)
}

```
***
## Question 2

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        continue
    }
    print(i)
}
```

[]1
[]2
[]3
[]4
[]5
[]6
[]7
[]8
[]9
[]10

***
## Question 3

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        break
    }
    print(i)
}
```

***
## Question 4

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print?  Explain below.

```swift
outerloop: for x in 1...3 {
    innerloop: for y in 1...3 {
        if y == 2{
            continue outerloop
        }
        print("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
    }
}
```

***
## Question 5

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** x and y are both integers.

***
## Question 6

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** the difference of x and y is at least 5, and x and y are both integers.

***
## Question 7

Print the first `N` square numbers. A **square number**, also called perfect square, is an integer that is obtained by squaring some other integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself (ex. 1 = 1*1, 4 = 2 * 2, 9 = 3* 3 â€¦).

Example:
Input: `var N = 5`

Output:
```swift
1
4
9
16
25
```

***
## Question 8

Given an integer N draw a square of N x N asterisks. Look at the examples.

Example 1:
Input: `var N = 2`

Output:
```swift
**
**
```

Example 2:
Input: `var N = 3`

Output:
```swift

Hint 1
Try printing a single line of * first.

Hint 2
You can use print("") to print an empty line.
