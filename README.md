***
## Question 11

Without using Xcode, how many times will the loop below run?  Explain why.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

// Your explanation here
_________________________
Answer:
It will run indefinite since it is adding numbers (i += 1) in while loop.
In terms for while loop to spot running we should decrementing numbers (i -=1).
```

***
## Question 12

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing when i reaches 9.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}
____________________
Answer:
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
    if i == 9 {
          break
}
}
print(i) 
// Output 9
```

***
## Question 13

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}
__________________
Answer:
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1        // It runs 1000 times
    if i == 1005 {
          break
}
}
print(i)
// Output 1005
```

***
## Question 14

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times and also make it print out the current value of i **only if i is an even number.**

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}
______________________
Answer:
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
    if i == 1005 {
    break
}
}
if i % 2 == 0 {
print(i)
}

// Output doesn't print since number is 1005 is not even.
```

***
## Question 15

What's the difference in syntax between the following two while loops?  Will their outputs be different?  Explain why or why not.

```swift
var i = 1
//loop one
while i <= 10 {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
}

//loop two
var i = 1

repeat {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
} while i <= 10
_______________________
Answer:
First example will print: 
"i = 1"
"i = 2"
"i = 3"
"i = 4"
"i = 5"
"i = 6"
"i = 7"
"i = 8"
"i = 9"
"i = 10"

I don't know what second loop will print.

```

# Bonus =)

***
## Question 1

What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?  Give an example that demonstrates their differences.
___________________________________
Answer:
Break will exit the loop and stop running it. Continue will go to the next number using when met some condition and we want to skip this number and move to the another number.

Break example:
for num in 1...10 {
    if num == 4 {
print("Happy birthday, Miles")
break // exit loop or end loop, stop looping
    } else {
print("Not your birthday yet, you are only \(num) years old")
}
}

// Output 
Not your birthday yet, you are only 1 years old
Not your birthday yet, you are only 2 years old
Not your birthday yet, you are only 3 years old
Happy birthday, Miles

var number = 3
while number < 40 {
number += 4
if number % 3 == 0 {
continue
}
print(number)
}
// Output 
7
11
19 // skips 15
23
31 // skips 27
35
43 // skips 39
## Question 2

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){

## Question 4

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print?  Explain below.

```swift
outerloop: for x in 1...3 {
    innerloop: for y in 1...3 {
        if y == 2{
            continue outerloop
        }
        print("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
    }
}

## Question 5

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** x and y are both integers.

***
## Question 6

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** the difference of x and y is at least 5, and x and y are both integers.

***
## Question 7

Print the first `N` square numbers. A **square number**, also called perfect square, is an integer that is obtained by squaring some other integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself (ex. 1 = 1*1, 4 = 2 * 2, 9 = 3* 3 â€¦).

Example:
Input: `var N = 5`

Output:
```swift
1
4
9
16
25
```

***
## Question 8

Given an integer N draw a square of N x N asterisks. Look at the examples.

Example 1:
Input: `var N = 2`

Output:
```swift
**
**
```

Example 2:
Input: `var N = 3`

Output:
```swift
***
***
***
```

Hint 1
Try printing a single line of * first.

Hint 2
You can use print("") to print an empty line.
