//  Answer:
for num in 1...100  {
    print(num)
}

***
## Question 2

Write code that prints all the numbers from 142 to 159, **exclusive.**

//  Answer:
for num in 142..<159    {
    print(num)
}

***
## Question 3

//  Answer:
for num in 15...80 where num % 2 == 0   {

***
## Question 5

Write code that prints all the numbers that end in a **5** from 1 to 100, **exclusive.**

//  Answer:
for number in 1..<100 where number % 10 == 5  {
    print("\(number) number ends in 5")
}

***
## Question 6

Write code that prints all the numbers that end in a 7 from 1 to 40, **inclusive.**

//  Answer:
for number in 1...40 where number % 10 == 7  {
    print("\(number) number ends in 7")
}

***
## Question 7

Given a range of numbers from 20 to 150 inclusive, print out all the numbers that follows these conditions:

`Numbers that are divisible by 3`

//  Answer:
for num in 20...150 where num % 3 == 0  {
    print(num)

}

***
## Question 9

Given a range of numbers from 20 to 150 inclusive, print out all the numbers that follows these conditions:

`Numbers that end with a 4`

//  Answer:
for number in 20...150 where number % 10 == 4  {
    print("\(number) number ends in 4")
}

***
## Question 10

Given a range of numbers from 20 to 150, print out all the numbers that follows these conditions:

`Print out numbers: 31, 35, 40 to 60.`

// Answer:
for number in 20...150  {
    if number == 31 || number == 35 || number == 40 || number == 60  {
        print(number)
    }
}

***
## Question 11

Without using Xcode, how many times will the loop below run?  Explain why.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

// Answer:
Infinitely, because i starts at 5 which makes the while condition true and always stays greater, doesn't decrement to be equal to or less than 3.

```

***
## Question 12

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing when i reaches 9.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

// Answer:
var i = 5

while (i < 9) {
    i += 1
}

```

***
## Question 13

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

//  Answser:
var i = 5

while (i < 1005) {
    i += 1
}

```

***
## Question 14

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times and also make it print out the current value of i **only if i is an even number.**

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

//  Answser:
var i = 5

while (i < 1005) {
    if i % 2 == 0   {
        print(i)
    }
    i += 1
}

//  Answers:


```

***
## Question 15

What's the difference in syntax between the following two while loops?  Will their outputs be different?  Explain why or why not.

```swift
var i = 1
//loop one
while i <= 10 {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
}

//loop two
var i = 1

repeat {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
} while i <= 10

//  Answer:
While will check condition first and run if it's true, repeat will run the code first and check if condition is true at the end. Written as is both will print to 10 and stop the loop at 11.

```

## Question 1

What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?  Give an example that demonstrates their differences.

***
## Question 2

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        continue
    }
    print(i)
}
```

## Question 3

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        break
    }
    print(i)
}
```

## Question 4

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print?  Explain below.

```swift
outerloop: for x in 1...3 {
    innerloop: for y in 1...3 {
        if y == 2{
            continue outerloop
        }
        print("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
    }
}
```

***
## Question 5

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** x and y are both integers.

***
## Question 6

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** the difference of x and y is at least 5, and x and y are both integers.

***
## Question 7

Print the first `N` square numbers. A **square number**, also called perfect square, is an integer that is obtained by squaring some other integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself (ex. 1 = 1*1, 4 = 2 * 2, 9 = 3* 3 â€¦).

Example:
Input: `var N = 5`

Output:
```swift
1
4
9
16
25
```

***
## Question 8

Given an integer N draw a square of N x N asterisks. Look at the examples.

Example 1:
Input: `var N = 2`

Output:
```swift
**
**
```

Example 2:
Input: `var N = 3`

Output:
```swift

```

Hint 1
Try printing a single line of * first.

Hint 2
You can use print("") to print an empty line.
