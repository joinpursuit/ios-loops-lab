        print(num)
    }
}
```
***
## Question 11

Without using Xcode, how many times will the loop below run?  Explain why.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

// Your explanation here
```
Answer
```swift
This will be an infinet loop since the condition is made to stop when i is less than 3 but in the loop it's only adding number to i and not subtracting. so i never gets less then 3
```
***
## Question 12

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing when i reaches 9.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}
```
Answer
```swift
var i = 5

while (i < 9) {
    i += 1
}
```
***
## Question 13

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3 ) {
    i += 1
}
```
Answer
```swift
var i = 5
var count = 1

while (count < 1000 ) {
    i += 1
}
```
***
## Question 14

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times and also make it print out the current value of i **only if i is an even number.**

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}
```
Answer
```swift
var i = 5
var count = 1

while (count < 1000) {
    if i % 2 == 0 {
        print(i)
    }
}
```
***
## Question 15

What's the difference in syntax between the following two while loops?  Will their outputs be different?  Explain why or why not.

```swift
var i = 1
//loop one
while i <= 10 {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
}

//loop two
var i = 1

repeat {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
} while i <= 10
```
Answer
```swift
The output will be the same since the while condition for both of the loop is set to stop on the same number
```

## Question 1

What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?  Give an example that demonstrates their differences.

Answer
```swift
You'll use 'break' when you want to exit out from the loop in a condition you specified
example listed below:

for num in 0..<100 {
    if num == 50 {
        break // this will stop the loop so the value gets printed is 0 to 49
    }
    print(num)
}

You'll use 'continue' when you want to skip to the next value in the loop
example listed below:

for num in 0..<100 {
    if num == 50 {
        continue // this will skip 50 so in this for loop the value that gets printed it 0 to 49 and 51 to 99
    }
    print(num)
}
```
***
## Question 2

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        continue
    }
    print(i)
}
```

    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        break
    }
    print(i)

## Question 4

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print?  Explain below.

```swift
outerloop: for x in 1...3 {
    innerloop: for y in 1...3 {
        if y == 2{
            continue outerloop
        }
        print("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
    }
}
```
Answer
```swift
on each'x' loop 'y' loop will do the entire loop with skipping 2 so below will be the outcome 
x = 1  y = 1
x = 1  y = 3
x = 2  y = 1
x = 2  y = 3
x = 3  y = 1
x = 3  y = 3
```
***
## Question 5

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** x and y are both integers.

Answer
```swift

```
***
## Question 6

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** the difference of x and y is at least 5, and x and y are both integers.

Answer
```swift
```
***
## Question 7

Print the first `N` square numbers. A **square number**, also called perfect square, is an integer that is obtained by squaring some other integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself (ex. 1 = 1*1, 4 = 2 * 2, 9 = 3* 3 â€¦).

Example:
Input: `var N = 5`

Output:
```swift
1
4
9
16
25
```
Answer
```swift
```
***
## Question 8

Given an integer N draw a square of N x N asterisks. Look at the examples.

Example 1:
Input: `var N = 2`

Output:

Example 2:
Input: `var N = 3`

Output:
